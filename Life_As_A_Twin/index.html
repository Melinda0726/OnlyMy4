            <h2>The difference Between Identical and Fraternal Twins</h2>
            <p>Identical twins (also called monozygotic twins) result from
               the fertilization of a single egg by a single sperm, with the
               fertilized egg then splitting into two. Identical twins share 
               the same genomes and are always of the same sex. Fraternal twins
               (also called dizygotic twins) result from the fertilization of 
               two separate eggs with two different sperm during the same 
               pregnancy. Fraternal twins may not have the same sex or appearance. 
               They share half their genomes, just like any other siblings.</p>

            <p>Often, identical twins can be identified in the womb, as they 
               often share a placenta. After birth, it can be deduced that twins 
               are fraternal if they are of different genders (a boy and a girl) 
               or if they have different blood types. However, the only way to 
               reliably conclude that they are identical twins is through genetic
               testing (a twin zygosity DNA test).</p>

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>I am a identical twin and i have a twin sister. We both share the same
               features when it comes to our appearance and when we were younger our
               mother used to get us confused and call us both by each others name. It
               was really hilarious up until now being 38 years old and she still does it
               sometimes!</p>

            <p>Flashback to my high school days. This was our senior year in high school
               and we posing for our senior pictures. I am the one standing up and we chose
               to take our pictures together. </p>
