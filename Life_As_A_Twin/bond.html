            <h2>The Ups and Downs</h2>
            <p>We had many of times were we felt like the world was against us. Not sure
               if it was just a twin thing but we didn't feel like we were our own person. 
               Everything we did was pretty much the same until we reached high school. 
               Although we remained close to each other we branched off and did our own things in life. </p>

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>I am a identical twin and i have a twin sister. We both share the same
               features when it comes to our appearance and when we were younger our
               mother used to get us confused and call us both by each others name. It
               was really hilarious up until now being 38 years old and she still does it
               sometimes!</p>

            <p>Flashback to my high school days. This was our senior year in high school
               and we posing for our senior pictures. I am the one standing up and we chose
               to take our pictures together. </p>
