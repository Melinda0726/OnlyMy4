            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Me and my sister have always been close. We used to do everything together
               as far as dressing the same everyday, eat the same foods, buy the same things
               and even worked a few jobs together. Our teenage years we remained that way 
               and as we got older we got more and more connected. Our kids are all best friends
               with each other and they have a tight bond. Coming from a family of 5 we were what
               they called "two peas in a pod".</p>
               <img id="main_img_resize" src="images/Bond.jpg" alt="Connection">

            <p>Straight out of high school, she got married and had a baby. I felt like
                i was alone. Having that twin connection meant alot to me and when she
                moved out of the state i was emotional and feeling a way that was hard
                for me to describe and only she knew how i felt exactly. </p>

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>I am a identical twin and i have a twin sister. We both share the same
               features when it comes to our appearance and when we were younger our
               mother used to get us confused and call us both by each others name. It
               was really hilarious up until now being 38 years old and she still does it
               sometimes!</p>

            <p>Flashback to my high school days. This was our senior year in high school
               and we posing for our senior pictures. I am the one standing up and we chose
               to take our pictures together. </p>
